## Claim your Satellite 2019 Octocat Creation!

Hi! I'm [@vilmibm](https://github.com/vilmibm)! I volunteered giving out attendee's custom octocats most of GitHub Satellite 2019. I felt bad about how many were left at the end of the night, so I threw them onto a page to hopefully get them to their rightful home.

## I see my octocat!

If you've located your buddy, click on it to open up your mail client. Send me the **Confirmation Code** from the email you received when you created the octocat and be in the subject like this: **MyOctocat Printing Confirmation: #XXXXXX**. Once I've matched your code with the octocat, I'll reply and figure out how to get it to you :)

## Octocats!
